# Architecture

The project is organized around GNSS data parsing and transport components.

## Main areas

- `ie.strix.gnss`: core GNSS data structures/utilities
- `ie.strix.gnss.nmea`: NMEA sentence models and parsing
- `ie.strix.gnss.ntrip`: NTRIP client/caster support
- `ie.strix.gnss.rtcm`: RTCM parsing support

## Build system

The project uses Maven for dependency management, testing, and code coverage, with JavaDoc generation integrated into the build lifecycle.

## Documentation approach

- Markdown docs are authored in the `docs/` folder.
- Java API docs are generated by Maven JavaDoc.
- GitHub Actions publishes both as a unified docs site on GitHub Pages.
